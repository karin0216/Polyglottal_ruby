# Diary app
This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

I created diary app using Ruby on rails. 
You can post diary with your feeling. If you choose feeling from five options, emoji appear on calendar so that you can easily keep track your feeling ðŸ˜Š

This app is hosted on Heroku. Feel free to try using it!
